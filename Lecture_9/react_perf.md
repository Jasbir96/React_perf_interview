# Foundational Truth:
*  The idea is simple, don't download code until the user needs it.

## Network Perf 
* bandwidth -> atleast the code should reach the end client
* code splitting 
    * dynamic import -> getting data
    * lazy and suspense ->  lazy load components  [route level]
    * lazy loading  part of screen -> Intersection obeserver


## react code Optization
* low processing power -> code reaches the end client

1. Network optimization : reducing bundle size
2. react internal optimzations
    VDOM
    Bathching
    Diffing Algo
3. React code level optimization
    a. cache  your component -> React.memo
    b. cache your function -> useCallback
    c. cache a calculation -> useMemo
